# Scroll-It
A simple auto scroller for Reddit image threads.


### Motivation
During the Lockdown of 2020, I had some time and wanted a small side project. I decided to try to learn more about [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) as I was using it for a work
project as well. My main source of inspiration was [Imagoid](http://www.imagoid.com/). I did not recreate it but instead just focused on the auto scrolling
functionality.

Furthermore, it should be more mobile-friendly. I used [Vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com/en/) for the front-end framework.

Hope you enjoy. Feel free to leave any issues.


#### Disclaimer
Code is messy. Vue isn't bad. Front-end is complicated.
